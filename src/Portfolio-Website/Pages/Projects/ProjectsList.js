      "The purpose of this project is to dynamically get all distinct food Categories and display a tab for each Category. Upon clicking one, all the food items falling under that category will be displayed. An Accordion can be accessed to show/hide more information. The page also contains a slider at the top, which automatically changes images every 2 seconds. Upon clicking the left/right buttons, user will be able to manually change the picture. User can also click on 'Surprise Me!' to get a random picture. (Project still in progress)",
